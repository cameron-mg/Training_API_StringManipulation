The identification of brain tumors is mostly conducted by neuropathologist and can be extremely challenging to detect within its initial stages, this can take decades of training. The various explicit features
used by neuropathologist can be employed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain scans within our dataset. The Brain Tumor dataset itself contains 3762 images, 1683 of which
being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.

The identification of brain tumors is mostly conducted by neuropathologist and can be extremely challenging to detect within its initial stages, this can take decades of training. The various explicit features
used by neuropathologist can be employed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain scans within our dataset. The Brain Tumor dataset itself contains 3762 images, 1683 of which
being positive for cancerous tumors and 2079 being negative. We will train our CNN on these images with the goal of successfully classifying them. 
Afterwards an ensemble will be created to test and compare to the CNN to see which results in more accurate predictions and fewer false negative predictions.
